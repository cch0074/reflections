How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	A staging area saves files in working directory that are waiting for next

	be committed at a time.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	Only "add" those files you want to commit (for a particular logical change)
	to the staging area, so that other unrelated but changed files won't be
	committed.
